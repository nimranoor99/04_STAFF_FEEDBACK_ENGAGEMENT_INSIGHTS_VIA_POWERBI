# 04_STAFF_FEEDBACK_ENGAGEMENT_INSIGHTS_USING_POWERBI

**Description:**
<br>
This project utilizes Power BI to analyze staff/employee performance data collected through an online survey. The initial dataset was cleaned and processed using Power Query to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure data accuracy. 
<br>

**Key Steps:**
<br>
1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
    - Imported the raw dataset into Power Query.

2. **Data Modeling:**
    - Defined data types and created calculated/groups columns to enhance data analysis capabilities.

3. **Data Visualization:**
    - Created interactive dashboards and reports using various Power BI visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, pie charts, maps) to present key insights.

4. **Insights and Analysis:**
- Overall Observations:
  - Employee Engagement: The scores for Coworkers, Learning New Things, and Management are relatively high (5.80, 5.02, and 4.98 out of 10, respectively), suggesting a generally positive work environment. However, Salary Satisfaction is lower at 4.37, indicating a potential area for improvement.
  - Diversity: The workforce appears to be diverse, with representation from various industries, countries, ethnicities, and genders.
- Industry Trends:
  - Tech and finance are the dominant industries, with higher average salaries than other sectors. Education appears to have the lowest average salary.
- Country Trends:
  - The United States and the United Kingdom have higher average salaries as compared to other countries. The distribution of employees across countries is not uniform, with some regions (e.g., North America) having a higher concentration.
- Programming Language Trends:
  - Python is the most popular programming language among employees. JavaScript and R also have significant usage.
- Demographic Trends:
  - Male employees slightly outnumber Female employees. Caucasian employees are the most represented ethnicity.
- Break Into Data Trend:
  - A significant proportion of employees (30.77%) find it "Neither easy nor difficult" to break into data. A smaller percentage find it "Very Easy" or "Very Difficult".
- Potential Areas for Improvement:
  - Salary Satisfaction: Addressing the lower salary satisfaction scores could be a priority. Analyzing factors contributing to this dissatisfaction (e.g., industry benchmarks, internal equity) would be crucial.
  - Diversity and Inclusion: While the workforce shows some diversity, further efforts to enhance diversity and inclusion initiatives could be beneficial.

**Future Enhancements:**
<br>
- Correlations: Examining potential correlations between factors like industry, country, gender, and employee satisfaction could provide deeper insights.
- Drill-down Analysis: Drilling down into specific segments of the data (e.g., employees in a particular country, employees in a specific industry) could reveal more granular insights.
- Time Series Analysis: If the data includes a time component, analyzing trends over time could provide valuable information about changes in employee satisfaction, diversity, and other key metrics.
